        <h1><center>THIS WEBSITE WAS A TRIP</center></h1>
        <p><center>i chose to review http://aaf.nyc/, Always and Forever Computer Entertainment. This website sucked me in right from the start. </center>

       <br><br/> I honestly did not know what i was getting into when i pressed any link leading me to a different website. I was not even sure what the website was about. Then i slowly started to get the theme of it all and how the website was constructed. 
            <br/>I spent a signifact amount of time on each link exploring the different ways you can interact with the website. I feel like a lot of it didnt have a real purpose but to maybe just get as far as seeing how ineractive the web can be and to test out how people do with it.</p>

                    <li>Dennis</li>
                    <li>George&Jonathan III</li>
                    <li>Chrome Experiments</li>
                
            
        
   
        
        <p><br>I liked Dennis because you can play music and the video will sync to every beat and drop and the song does. All the shapes come together at the sound of the music and each video is never repeated. As long as you have new music the movement and shapes will make a different video. All the funky shapes made me want to see this with a fun song so i chose to experience this with this cool track.

        George and Jonathan III give you a visual to a whole album. You can move you mouse and move along with the shapes as sort of like an outter space experience.

            Chrome Experiments will have you sitting in your chair for hours. Filled with interctive websites that is randomly choosen amongst bubbles tha form out the number 1000. You never know what your going to get and thats pretty fun. I can see this being a very cool place for someone into web developing and always coming up with different ideas. </p><br>

           <p>I wish i would have kept better track of all the links i got when i pressed one bubble so i would recommend to someone if they find a site they like, to write it down or save it in your favorites to go back and get lost in it when thet feel. This opened up my eyes to remind me of other ways the web can be used for as opposed ot just keeping up with social media and googleing personal things. The web is literally full of possibilities and cool things that you can do to stimulate your mind and or get your mind off of being bored.</p>
