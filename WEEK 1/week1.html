        <h1>Hello!!</h1>
        <p>My name is Francheska Bello. I am a native New Yorker, born and raised in Queens. I am a photographer and currently attend FIT in New York City. Aside from photogrpahy, my other hobby is eating and trying good food. I am open to all types of food. I enjoy delicasies and home cooked meals made with love. Although i cannot cook, i enjoy the ingredients and watching how its made. Food is always a great way to get everyone together.
