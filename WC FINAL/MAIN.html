<center><h5>The rain drops run across my pane,<br>
The window screeching with wind pushing in;<br>
The Cracks let the cold squeeze past as<br>
My melancholy seeps out.<br>
<br>
Sweet melancholy,<br>
Found in me,<br>
With its own seat,<br>
Spread comfortably<br><br>

Across my arteries;<br>
Across my eyes;<br>
Across my mind gone;<br>
Lost in times..<br><br>

Fragmented I hold,<br>
Almost suffocate,<br>
This sweet melancholy<br>
With its definite place.<br><br>

Kept close for its solace;<br>
Kept deep in my eye;<br>
A hurricane of cravings,<br>
Lashing about.<br><br>

Its safety guaranteed as <br>
Its eternal recurrence.<br>
I sink as it floats on,<br>
Perpetuating<br><br>

Cycles of pain<br>
Known as my own;<br>
Whether circumstance blessed me or<br>
Seeds long since sown<br><br>

Have bloomed for our union.<br>
I'll never be sure,<br>
But one things consistent,<br>
Our codependency's pure.<br><br>
         
The winds hold a cold breeze;<br>
The sun vibrates fast;<br>
The mists within the blows heed:<br>
Times are past.<br><br>

Tension flies faster than lightning;<br>
Motions, cascading,<br>
Pour into me<br>
Causing cold skin, enflammed beats.<br><br>

The rain holds the same old tune<br>
Whispering lyrics in my ear<br>
Telling my soul to be clear<br>
My body simply to grow<br>

Glow...<br><br>

Let<br>
Live for the flow..<br>

Rivers forming remind:<br>
There's always time<br>
As long as we move.<br><br>

Many things grind the stones,<br>
None more than a currents force;<br>
Upstream can seem saved,<br>
But down is the ocean of course<br>
Waiting for you to let go, absorbed.</h5>
